# Pseudo E-Commerce App

This project is a pseudo e-commerce web application built for learning purposes and to create a full-stack web app experience but the project is more focused on backend developement consequently you may find that sometimes the front end is negelected to favor the front end.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into three main folders:

- **frontend**: Built using React.js with Vite as the bundler. Contains the client-side application for managing products and orders.
- **api**: Contains the backend API built with Node.js/Express. Organized into controllers, routes, server setup, middleware, errors, models, and documentation.
- **db**: Contains JSON and log files for storing data locally on the machine.

## Frontend

The frontend is a React.js application built using Vite as the bundler. It provides a user interface for interacting with the pseudo e-commerce application.

## Backend
The backend API is organized into several directories and files:

- **controllers/**: Contains controller files that handle business logic for different resources (e.g., products, orders).
- **routes/**: Defines API routes and their corresponding handlers.
- **server.js**: Entry point that initializes and starts the Express server.
- **middleware/**: Includes middleware functions used for request processing (e.g., authentication, logging).
- **errors/**: Contains custom error handling middleware and error classes.
- **models/**: Defines data models or schemas used for interacting with the database or local data storage (e.g., JSON files).
- **docs/**: Documentation folder containing API documentation files (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger specifications).

### Features

- CRUD operations for managing products and orders.
- Responsive UI for different screen sizes.
- Integration with the backend API for data fetching and updating.
## Purpose
The project serves as a hands-on learning experience in full-stack web development, integrating React.js frontend with Node.js/Express backend and local data storage.

## Future Plans
Future iterations may include integrating a more robust database system, implementing authentication mechanisms, enhancing error handling, and optimizing performance.
